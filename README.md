This is a little quiz GUI i made. This code could be expanded by adding a random element to it to randomly select a set of questions and answers.

Conclusion:
GUIzero would useful in embedded contols because it offers the user a simple way to interface with sensor data, and controls. It's much more user friendly and space efficeint to have a GUI to control you system rather than clunky physical buttons and sliders. Also GUIzero makes it easy to program games like the quiz above.
